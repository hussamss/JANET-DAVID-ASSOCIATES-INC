A coach and advisor, the Operations Specialist partners with A&W restaurant operators to help them improve their management skills so that A&W restaurants achieve and sustain operational excellence and superior results for sales growth, profitability, and guest satisfaction. The Operations Specialist also works with representatives of A&W’s corporate Marketing, Real Estate and Franchising teams.
